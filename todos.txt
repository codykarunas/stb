# PROJECT OBJECTIVE

1. Build a P.O.S. System for a Restaurant with self-service. This system will
simulate a restaurant ordering system in that it will:

  1) place an order containing several food items, 
  2) send messages to different terminals telling workers what to make, 
  3) allow workers to indicate that the food is done, 
  4) checkoff that the order is assembled and delivered and 
  5) allow the customer to serve themselves from a kiosk or app

# TODOS

Actually persist the Order to the Database.

Figure out the relationship between current_user and order
  ex: current_user.order.total_price

Then we can assign that current_user orders' total_price to the Stripe amount attribute
