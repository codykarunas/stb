simulate a restaurant ordering system in that it will:

  1) place an order containing several food items, 
  2) send messages to different terminals telling workers what to make, 
  3) allow workers to indicate that the food is done, 
  4) checkoff that the order is assembled and delivered and 
  5) allow the customer to serve themselves from a kiosk or app
